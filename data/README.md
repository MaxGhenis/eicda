ACS data extracted and subset from 
https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/supplemental-poverty-measure/acs-research-files.html, since the full file is too large to store in GitHub (~900MB, ~140MB zipped). `save_acs.py` only needs to be run once.

Carbon footprint data provided by Kevin Ummel, author of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act Household Impact Study.
